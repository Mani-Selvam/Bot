As a relatively newer company (founded in 2017)
null
their large-scale project portfolio might be less extensive compared to more established players in the solar industry. The limited number of publicly available customer reviews makes it challenging to gauge broad customer satisfaction and consistent service quality across a wider client base. Specific details about the scale of their manufacturing operations

certifications
null
or patented technologies are not extensively highlighted on the website
null
potentially requiring direct inquiry for more in-depth information. Primarily operates with a regional focus within Telangana and Karnataka

though they may undertake projects nationally.
